# Simple-Game-Server-Management-Tool
I want to build a MC and CoreKeeper game sever management tool so I can back up, restart, and restore the game server easily. 

# There are few goals I want to achieve:
- I can setup the backup tiem and location of the game save file.
- I can select the backuped file to restore it.
- I can check the recouse usage of the server.
- I can update the server with comand or upload file.
- I can start, stop, and restart the game server.
